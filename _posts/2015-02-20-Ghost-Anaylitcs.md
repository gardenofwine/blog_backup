This blog website has been online for a while now, and you can read [here]() and [here]() about how I set it up. I didn't do ANY marketing, no twitting and no posts HackerNews; I only sent a few links to this blog in various registration forms. The reason I didn't do it is I am waiting for Analytics. I want to know how many people are viewing my posts. So this is my last post before publishing my blog.

## Google analytics
I know there are various analytics tools out there that are much simpler to understand, but by far, Google Analytics is the most popular one. At least when googling about "Ghost analytics". To be fair, Google Analytics is also the first result when doing the same search on Bing (see below).

At any rate, [this tutorial](http://www.ghostforbeginners.com/how-to-add-google-analytics-to-ghost/) is just on the spot. To log into my hosting server via bitnami, I followed the steps in my previous [post]().
